**CUSTOM FILTERS:** <br> <br>
**OISD Domain Blocklist** (full list) | [add](https://oisd.nl/downloads)
<br> "The Best Blocklist" - OISD combines [hundreds of lists](https://oisd.nl/includedlists) and filters out the false positives. If you ever tried the [Energized project](https://github.com/EnergizedProtection/block) but became annoyed at all the breakage, then this list is for you. The maintainer is [very responsive](https://www.reddit.com/r/oisd_blocklist/comments/m6j6fg/oisd_domain_blocklist/?sort=new) to false positive reports. He also provides a domain-list version if you use Pihole, and it is listed on [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/?from=xujj63g5). Phenominal project. [I've yet to find a list that he hasn't heard of](https://oisd.nl/allknownlists.php).

**Privacy Essentials** | [add](https://github.com/yokoffing/filterlists/blob/main/PrivacyEssentials.txt)
<br> Blocks requests not covered by EasyPrivacy or OISD like `connect.facebook.com` as well as non-essential scripts on webpages. Allows for embedded tweets and Instagram post.
  
**Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List** | [add](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/AnnoyancesList)
<br> This list includes [Legitimate URL Shortener Tool](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/LegitimateURLShortener.txt) and [Browse websites without logging in](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/BrowseWebsitesWithoutLoggingIn.txt), among other useful lists. (BTW, if you find websites with useless/tracking parameters, you can submit them [here](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/discussions/163?sort=new).) If this list is too heavy-handed for your tastes, I'd at least add the two aforementioned lists.
  
**yokoffing's Annoyance List** | [add](https://github.com/yokoffing/filterlists/blob/main/AnnoyanceList)
<br> A curated annoyance list that captures nuisances missed by other maintainers. It also cleans up the cludder around many sites. I'll say it ahead of time: You're welcome ;)
